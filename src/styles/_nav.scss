// It seems like overflow-y is set to "auto" for screensize below screen-md-min (768px)
// (see node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_navbar.scss:60)

// Perhaps the menu shouldn't show like that on mobile, but should be displayed differently?
// Setting this to visible to always show dropdown menus for now.
